      <!-- Week 5 -->
<div id="week5" class="week-content">
  <h2>Week V</h2>
  <p>
    I learned how to give a <b>proper and effective presentation</b>. Through this, I understood:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The purpose of a presentation — to inform, influence, motivate, or educate an audience.</li>
    <li>Presentations have two objectives:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Primary objective:</b> The main goal of the presentation.</li>
        <li><b>Secondary objectives:</b> To engage, inspire, or support the audience’s understanding.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The content and tone of the presentation should match the audience (e.g., formal for business, casual for students).</li>
    <li>How to design an effective PowerPoint presentation:
      <ul>
        <li>Use clear and simple slides.</li>
        <li>Maintain consistent formatting.</li>
        <li>Use Arial or Calibri font; size 14 for headings, 12 for content.</li>
        <li>Limit to three colors for a professional appearance.</li>
        <li>Avoid underlining text and use sentence case.</li>
        <li>Always proofread the slides before presenting.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Presentation delivery includes verbal and non-verbal components:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Verbal:</b> Clarity of speech, appropriate tone, and vocabulary.</li>
        <li><b>Non-verbal:</b> Eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, and posture.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Using cue cards can help stay on track during the presentation.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- Week 6 -->
<div id="week6" class="week-content">
  <h2>Week VI</h2>
  <p>
    In <b>Week Six</b>, I learned about <b>public speaking</b>, its objectives, different forms, and the importance of developing this skill. Public speaking helps individuals express their thoughts confidently, influence others, and communicate ideas effectively in various situations, such as presentations, debates, or discussions. I also explored different types of public speaking topics and the strategies to handle each one efficiently.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Abstract topics</b> – Focus on ideas or concepts that don’t have a physical form, such as “freedom” or “happiness.”</li>
    <li><b>Case-based topics</b> – Involve analyzing a specific situation or event and presenting logical viewpoints about it.</li>
    <li><b>Factual or scientific topics</b> – Require the speaker to rely on data, evidence, and proven facts to support their statements.</li>
    <li><b>Prescription-based topics</b> – Focus on providing suggestions or solutions to address a problem.</li>
    <li><b>Informational topics</b> – Aim to educate or inform the audience about something new.</li>
    <li><b>“What if” topics</b> – Encourage creative and hypothetical thinking by imagining alternative scenarios or possibilities.</li>
    <li><b>Problem-solution-based topics</b> – Identify a specific problem and propose practical and effective solutions to resolve it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Overall, learning about these topic types and strategies has improved my understanding of how to prepare and deliver effective speeches depending on the purpose and audience.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="week7" class="week-content">
  <h2>Week VII</h2>
  <p>
    In <b>Week Seven</b>, I learned about the <b>Art of Conversation</b>, which focused on developing effective communication skills through <b>small talk</b> and <b>telephone etiquettes</b>. This week helped me understand how small talk can make interactions more comfortable and how proper telephone etiquettes create a positive impression in professional and personal settings.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understood what small talk is and how it helps in starting and maintaining conversations smoothly.</li>
    <li>Learned why small talk is important in building relationships and creating friendly communication.</li>
    <li>Explored various applications of small talk in everyday interactions, interviews, and workplace communication.</li>
    <li>Studied <b>telephone etiquettes</b> and their importance in ensuring polite, clear, and professional communication over calls.</li>
    <li>Understood the do’s and don’ts of telephone communication — such as greeting properly, speaking clearly, and avoiding background noise or distractions.</li>
    <li>Participated in a <b>simulation role play</b> activity to practice both small talk and telephone etiquettes in real-life situations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Overall, this week improved my ability to communicate effectively, helped me practice professional behavior over the phone, and boosted my confidence in conversational skills through role play exercises.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="week8" class="week-content">
  <h2>Week VIII</h2>
  <p>
    In <b>Week Eight</b>, I revised and reflected on all the topics learned in the previous weeks. This revision helped me strengthen my understanding and improve my communication skills. I reviewed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to give a confident and structured self-introduction.</li>
    <li>The importance of body language, tone, and expressions in communication.</li>
    <li>My strengths and weaknesses in public speaking and ways to improve them.</li>
    <li>How to work effectively in groups through role plays and activities.</li>
    <li>The key elements of an effective presentation — from design to delivery.</li>
    <li>Different types of public speaking topics and how to prepare for them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By revising all these concepts, I became more confident in speaking, presenting, and expressing my ideas clearly. It also helped me understand how continuous practice leads to personal and professional growth.
  </p>
</div> 
<div id="week9" class="week-content">
  <h2>Week IX</h2>
  <p>
    In <b>Week Nine</b>, my group (<b>Group 8</b>) gave a presentation on <b>laws against cyberbullying and harassment</b>. This topic was important because it helped us understand how legal systems protect people from online threats and misuse of technology.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We researched different laws related to cyberbullying and online harassment.</li>
    <li>I learned about the <b>Information Technology Act, 2000</b> and its role in preventing cybercrimes in India.</li>
    <li>Our group discussed real-life cases to show how these laws are applied.</li>
    <li>We highlighted how victims can report incidents and stay safe online.</li>
    <li>I improved my confidence, teamwork, and presentation skills during this activity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This presentation made me more aware of digital responsibility and the importance of respecting others online. It also helped me grow as a communicator and a responsible digital citizen.
